Java code for continuous generation of random Point-of-Sale Invoices (**PosInvoice**) for use when developing `Kafka Streams` applications and microcervices. This version employs `JSON Serialization`, but can easily be modified to employ `Avro Serialization`. This code has been tested against `standalone Kafka` as well as with `Confluent Kafka Platform`.
